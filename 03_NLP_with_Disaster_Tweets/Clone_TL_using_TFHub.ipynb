    "**Transfer Learning** is a research problem in machine learning (ML) that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer Learning overcomes the problem of isolated laerning by applying the knowledge gained during learning one task to another different but similar task. For example, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could be applied when trying to recognize trucks! The intuition actually came from the humans. We humans always practice *Transfer Learning*. A person who knows how to drive a bike, finds it easy to learn how to drive a car. Similarly *Transfer Learning* helps in learning difficult tasks with less effort."
